# Introduction
Poggle is a React Component library aimed at speeding up the development of React websites. Poggle was built using TypeScript, to make it scalable and also minimise errors when developing. Poggle
has many prebuilt components that allow you to easily setup a website or project.

The goal of Poggle was to make it easier for freelancers or teams to build and test an idea in under an hour, drastically reducing the development process to validate ideas.

Poggle is currently <b>version 1.0.422</b> - This is still an <b>in-development version</b> of our project. We expect a commercial build to be ready at <b>version 1.1.0</b>. So please keep that in mind if you are using Poggle.

# Font Installation
Poggle was built using the Roboto font, as we found it the most elegant. Please be sure to add this to the index.html of your project, by copying and pasting the following code:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,700&display=swap"/>
```
