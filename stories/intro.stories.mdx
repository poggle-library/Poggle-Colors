# Introduction
Poggle is a React Component library aimed at speeding up the development of React websites. Poggle was built using TypeScript, to make it scalable and also minimise errors when developing.

## Install Poggle
You can easily install Poggle from NPM or Yarn using the following commands in your terminal:

##### NPM

```
npm install @Poggle/core
```
##### Yarn

```
yarn add @Poggle/core
```

# Font Installation
Poggle was built using the Roboto font, as we found it the most elegant. Please be sure to add this to the index.html of your project, by copying and pasting the following code:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,700&display=swap"/>
```
